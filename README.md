# youtube-playlist-checker
A simple script to check a YT playlist and notify you via email

# To start the project
First install all of the dependency packages with 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once the installation is complete run the script with 
```
python3 main.py
```

If you'd like to run the script without having to keep a terminal session running, you can either do it via a screen or install a process manager, 
such as [pm2](https://pm2.io/blog/2018/09/19/Manage-Python-Processes) or any other that you like
